Hello, my name is **Manh** (Nguyễn Hữu Mạnh in Vietnamese). I am pursuing my PhD journey under the supervision of <a href='https://thaihungle.github.io/'>Dr. Hung Le</a> and <a href='https://experts.deakin.edu.au/2643-sunil-gupta/'>Prof. Sunil Gupta</a> at <a href='https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/'>A2I2</a>, Deakin University. My thesis, **"Towards Reliable Large Language Models for Open-ended Question Answering"**, aims to explore how we can build more trustworthy AI systems that can handle open-ended questions effectively. Prior to my PhD, I spent five years applying machine learning to solve real-world data science challenges in industry.

I focus on **practical NLP research**, building robust and scalable systems that translate research ideas into real-world impact.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly **running** and **swimming**), traveling, and going on hikes with friends.
