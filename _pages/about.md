Hello, my name is **Manh** (Nguyễn Hữu Mạnh in Vietnamese). I am pursuing my PhD journey under the supervision of <a href='https://thaihungle.github.io/'>Dr.Hung Le</a> at <a href='https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/'>A2I2</a>, Deakin University. My research interests are in the **explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, including hallucinations and fine-tuning techniques. Before that, I spent 5 years applying machine learning to solve data science problems in the industrial fields such as **marketing**, **fintech**, and **natural language processing**.

I am passionate about working with data to solve real-world problems. I am interested in all aspects of data science, and particularly in **data engineering**, **applying machine learning models**, and building **robust and scalable data-driven systems**. 

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly **running** and **swimming**), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family.
