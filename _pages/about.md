Hello, my name is **Manh** (Nguyễn Hữu Mạnh in Vietnamese). I am pursuing my PhD journey under the supervision of <a href='https://thaihungle.github.io/'>Dr. Hung Le</a> and <a href='https://experts.deakin.edu.au/2643-sunil-gupta/'>Prof. Sunil Gupta</a> at <a href='https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/'>A2I2</a>, Deakin University. My research focuses on the **reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in detecting and mitigating hallucinations. Prior to my PhD, I spent five years applying machine learning to solve real-world data science challenges in industry.

I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems, with a particular focus on **NLP research** and developing **robust, scalable, and production-ready data-driven systems**. I thrive at the intersection of research and application, turning innovative models into practical solutions with measurable impact.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly **running** and **swimming**), traveling, and going on hikes with friends.
