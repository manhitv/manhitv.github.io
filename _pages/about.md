# I'm about to start my PhD journey under the supervision of <a href='https://thaihungle.github.io/'>Dr.Hung Le</a> at <a href='https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au/'>Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2)</a>, Deakin University at the end of 2024. My research interests are in the **explainability of Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Before that I spent more than 5 years applying machine learning to solve data science problems in the fields of **marketing**, **fintech**, **natural language processing** and **computer vision**.

I am **Manh** (Nguyễn Hữu Mạnh in Vietnamese), a **Data Scientist** at <a href='https://xpon.ai/'>XPON Technologies Group</a>. My work focused on developing the data science portion of <a href='https://wondaris.com/'>Wondaris</a> (a Customer Data Platform product).

I am passionate about working with data to solve real-world problems. I am interested in all aspects of data science, and particularly in **data engineering**, **applying machine learning** and **deep learning models**, and building **robust and scalable data-driven systems**. 

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly **running** and **swimming**), traveling, and going on hikes with friends and family.
